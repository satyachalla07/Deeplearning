# Deeplearning
Remote sensing Image data 
Remote sensing devices or instruments have made gathering information about the Earth's surface and atmosphere easier. eg. sensors, drones, satellite etc
These information play a crucial role in various fields, including environmental monitoring, agriculture, forestry, geology, urban planning, and more.
Machine Learning and deep learning has the potential of processing these information and finding useful pattern.
Various machine learning & deep learning algorithms are proposed in literature for remote sensing image scene classification.
